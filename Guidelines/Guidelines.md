# Questions to pose when doing (and analysing the results of) pathway analysis:
- How large are the pathways you are looking at?
- Keep the hierarchy of pathways in mind: 
  + Some pathways occur in multiple other pathways, are all these processes likely to be affected?
  + When multiple pathways are found, which higher level processes are they a part of?
  + When the proteins you are interested in are in higher level pathways, are they constituents of one sub-process, or spread out over many sub-processes?
- Are the proteins you are interested in present in multiple pathways? Do they have a different set of interactors and/or function depending on the pathway? 
- Keep in mind where the proteins are in the network
  + How many of the proteins you are interested in are not annotated in the database?
  + What are the scores for radiality and integration? In which categories would the proteins fall? If they are all isolated proteins, can you find out more about them?
  + Are the proteins you are interested in close together in the network?
  + Are the proteins you are interested in dependent on other proteins to form complexes to perform their functions in any of the pathways? Are those proteins present?
  + Can you specify the proteoforms in your sample and use those to get more specific results?
